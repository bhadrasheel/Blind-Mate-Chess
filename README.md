# Chess-with-Gestures
Empowering Blind Players with Gesture-Controlled Online Chess

<div align="justify">

A voice-assisted chess application specifically designed to assist blind individuals in playing chess. This innovative application utilizes computer vision techniques, employing a trained YOLO model for object detection and localization to identify the chessboard's position on a physical board. By integrating a machine learning model trained for chess piece recognition, the application recognizes and updates the internal representation of the chessboard. The user interacts with the application through speech recognition, providing moves in algebraic notation. The application confirms and converts the recognized moves into corresponding actions on the chessboard using simulated mouse movements. With audio feedback provided using text-to-speech synthesis, blind users can play chess independently and enjoy an engaging gaming experience. The application works on Lichess platform, allowing users to participate in online chess games.
